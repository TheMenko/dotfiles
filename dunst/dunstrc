    ### Display ###

    # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
    #
    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.
